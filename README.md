# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis
This project aims to analyze hotel booking cancellations and identify factors that influence cancellation rates in City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The goal is to provide insights and recommendations to help both hotels improve their efficiency in generating revenue and reduce cancellation rates.

**Problem Statement**
City Hotel and Resort Hotel are facing high cancellation rates, leading to decreased revenues and underutilization of hotel rooms. The primary objective of this project is to analyze hotel booking cancellations and other factors that may affect their business and yearly revenue generation. The key questions to be addressed are:
* What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
* How can hotel reservation cancellations be reduced?
* How can hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?
* Data Gathering and Assumptions
* Data for this analysis has been collected from 2015 to 2017.
 
 **The following assumptions are made:**
No unusual occurrences between 2015 and 2017 have significantly impacted the data used.
The data is still relevant and can be used to efficiently analyze hotel plans.
There are no unforeseen negative consequences to the hotels implementing the suggested solutions.
The hotels are not currently using the proposed solutions.
Booking cancellations are the most significant factor affecting revenue generation.
Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the booked duration.
Customers make hotel reservations in the same year they make cancellations.

**Analysis and Findings**
The exploratory data analysis and data cleaning process revealed insights such as:
* Approximately 37% of clients canceled their reservations, significantly impacting hotel earnings.
* City hotels have more bookings compared to resort hotels, which may be due to the difference in pricing.
* Cancellations are more common when prices are higher, and the highest number of cancellations occurs in January.
* Portugal has the highest number of reservation cancellations among the analyzed countries.
* The majority of clients (around 46%) make reservations through online travel agencies.
  
**Recommendations**
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to help reduce cancellation rates and increase revenue:
Optimize Pricing Strategies: Hotels can work on their pricing strategies and offer discounts or special rates for specific hotels based on locations or time periods. Lowering prices during off-peak times may encourage more bookings and reduce cancellations.

* Weekend and Holiday Discounts: Resort hotels can provide reasonable discounts on room prices during weekends and holidays to attract more guests and reduce cancellation rates.

* January Marketing Campaign: Hotels can initiate marketing campaigns with reasonable offers in January to increase revenue, as this is the month with the highest cancellation rates.

* Improve Quality and Services: Focusing on improving the quality of hotels and services, especially in Portugal, may help reduce cancellation rates and enhance guest satisfaction.


**Additional Notes**
Please keep in mind that the analysis is based on the assumptions and data available up to 2017. Newer data or changes in the hotel industry may affect the validity of the findings and recommendations. It is recommended to regularly update the analysis with the latest data for more accurate insights.
